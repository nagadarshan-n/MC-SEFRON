# MC-SEFRON: A Python toolbox for Spiking Neural Network.

I'm maintaining python version of MC-SEFRON

Matlab version of MC-SEFRON: https://github.com/Abeegithan/MC-SEFRON

This toolbox uses time-varying functions as weights. If you are using time-varying weight models please cite SEFRON and if you are using this toolbox please cite MC-SEFRON.

Regular updates on this project are posted at https://www.researchgate.net/project/Spiking-Neural-Networks-7

Example: Iris train and test dataset are given in iris_train_1.csv and iris_test_1.csv respectively. Run the Main.py file to train the MC-SEFRON.

Note: Change the hyperparamets for other problems.
